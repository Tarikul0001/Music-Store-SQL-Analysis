# Welcome to the Music Store SQL Analysis! ðŸŽ¶

Hey there! Thanks for checking out this project. Itâ€™s a fun collection of SQL queries that dive into a music store database to answer some cool business questions. Whether youâ€™re a SQL newbie or a seasoned pro, these queries will help you explore customer habits, top-selling artists, and more. Letâ€™s get started!

## Whatâ€™s This All About?
This project is like a treasure hunt through a music storeâ€™s data. Weâ€™ve got queries that range from super easy to brain-bendingly advanced, all designed to uncover insights about customers, invoices, tracks, and artists. Itâ€™s perfect for learning SQL, practicing joins, or just geeking out over music data.

## The Database Lowdown
The music store database is packed with tables that hold all the juicy details:
- **customer**: Whoâ€™s buying? (Think `customer_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, `country`).
- **invoice**: The receipts! (Includes `invoice_id`, `customer_id`, `billing_city`, `billing_country`, `total`).
- **invoice_line**: Whatâ€™s in each receipt? (Like `invoice_line_id`, `invoice_id`, `track_id`, `unit_price`, `quantity`).
- **track**: Song details (e.g., `track_id`, `album_id`, `genre_id`, `name`, `milliseconds`).
- **album**: Album info (e.g., `album_id`, `artist_id`, `title`).
- **artist**: The rockstars! (Just `artist_id` and `name`).
- **genre**: Music vibes (e.g., `genre_id`, `name`).
- **employee**: The folks running the show (e.g., `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `title`, `levels`).

## Whatâ€™s in the Query Stash?
The queries are split into three levels, so thereâ€™s something for everyone:

### Easy Peasy Queries
1. **Whoâ€™s the Big Boss?**: Finds the employee with the fanciest job title.
2. **Invoice Hotspots**: Shows which countries are racking up the most invoices.
3. **Biggest Spenders**: Lists the top 3 invoice totals.
4. **Party City**: Picks the city with the most sales for a music festival bash.
5. **Top Customer**: Crowns the customer whoâ€™s dropped the most cash.

### Moderate Challenges
1. **Rock â€˜nâ€™ Roll Fans**: Grabs emails, names, and genres for Rock music lovers, sorted by email.
2. **Rock Band Royalty**: Lists the top 10 Rock artists with the most tracks.
3. **Epic Jams**: Finds tracks longer than the average song, sorted by length.

### Advanced Quests
1. **Artist Fan Spending**: Shows how much each customer spent on the top-selling artist.
2. **Genre Kings by Country**: Finds the most popular music genre in each country.
3. **Countryâ€™s Top Shoppers**: Tracks down the biggest spenders in each country.

## How to Jump In
1. **Get Set Up**: Youâ€™ll need a SQL database (like SQL Server, MySQL, or PostgreSQL) with the music store data loaded.
2. **Run the Queries**: Grab the SQL queries from the repo and pop them into your SQL tool.
3. **Tweak if Needed**: Some queries use SQL Serverâ€™s `TOP` syntax. Swap it for `LIMIT` if youâ€™re using MySQL or PostgreSQL.
4. **Explore the Results**: Use the outputs to spot trends, like whoâ€™s obsessed with Rock or which city loves music the most.

## Whatâ€™s in the Repo?
- `queries.sql`: All the SQL queries, neatly organized by difficulty.
- `README.md`: Youâ€™re reading it! A friendly guide to the project.

## What Youâ€™ll Need
- A database system (SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- The music store database set up and ready to go.
- A sprinkle of SQL knowledge to follow along (or just curiosity to learn!).

## How to Use

1. **Setup:** Ensure you have access to a SQL database (e.g., SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL) with the music store schema loaded.
2. **Run Queries:** Copy and paste the SQL queries from the repository into your SQL client or editor.
3. **Modify as Needed:** Adjust the syntax (e.g., TOP 1 for SQL Server, LIMIT 1 for MySQL/PostgreSQL) based on your database system.
4. **Analyze Results:** Use the query results to gain insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and music preferences.

## Quick Tips
- The queries match the database schema above. If your table names are different, give â€™em a quick tweak.
- SQL Serverâ€™s `TOP` might need to become `LIMIT` for other databases.
- Advanced queries use CTEs and window functionsâ€”make sure your database supports them.
